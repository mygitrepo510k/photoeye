      <td width="480" valign="top"> <p>THE PHOTOBOOK AS AN ART FORM in its own 
          right&#8212; it&#8217;s a concept that&#8217;s been steadily gathering 
          force. Photography collectors are not only being seduced by large-scale 
          prints they can hang on their walls, they&#8217;re gobbling up tomes 
          to stack on their shelves. In response to the flurry of interest, publishers 
          are putting out more exquisitely rendered, beautifully printed monographs, 
          while vintage first editions are garnering top dollar at auction.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if evidence of the growing popularity 
          of these bound and printed gems is apparent anywhere, it has been at 
          some of the photography fairs taking place across Europe. Publishers 
          are clamoring to exhibit and book aisles are crammed with elbowpoking 
          enthusiasts.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May of this year, photo-London (now 
          in its fourth edition and recently reconfigured to focus exclusively 
          on photography from 1970 to the present) featured numerous book signings 
          along with a panel discussion on the subject of photography books and 
          the future of publishing. This month, the 2007 edition of Paris Photo 
          will feature 22 publishers on its roster, including names from a wide 
          spectrum of locals, such as Bologna, Italy&#8217;s Damiani Editore, 
          London-based Simon Finch Rare Books, East Hampton, New York&#8211;based 
          Harper&#8217;s Books. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year at the 38th edition of France&#8217;s long-standing 
          and internationally trafficked Rencontres d&#8217;Arles festival, photobooks 
          didn&#8217;t necessarily steal the show, but they sure made their presence 
          felt&#8212;a little like Cinderella at the ball, everyone was talking 
          about them.</p>
