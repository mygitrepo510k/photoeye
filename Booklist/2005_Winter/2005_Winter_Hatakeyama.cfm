    <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  On September 30, 2005, an exhibition entitled "Tokyo, A City of Light: Photographs by Naoya Hatakeyama" opened in the Atrium Gallery of the Marion
Center for Photographic Arts on the campus of the College of
Santa Fe. Surprisingly, this is the first solo exhibition in the
United States for one of Japan’s leading art photographers. It
affords us the opportunity to both discuss his work and survey
the numerous books that he has produced over the course of
25 years of image-making.

<BR /><BR />
Hatakeyama (b. 1958, Iwate, Japan), a tall, slender man
with close-cropped black hair and fluid, elegant hands, has said
that his photographic practice has been “like kicking a stone
from place to place. The most exciting thing is to find the next
picture I want to take.”

<BR /><BR />
The stone that Hatakeyama has been kicking around has led
him from the limestone quarries of Okinawa and Hokkaido
and the cement factories that process the stone, to the tops of
Tokyo’s skyscrapers and the bowels of her buried river system.
Curated by Yasufumi Nakamori, the show takes for its theme
the vastness of Tokyo—a subject that is an ongoing source of
attraction and fascination for Hatakeyama. Nakamori’s accompanying
essay—which is excerpted here—insightfully discusses
the photographer’s approach to his art. At the end of this article
is select bibliography on the photographer.
