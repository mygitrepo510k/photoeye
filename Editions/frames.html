No tools are required to quickly and easily swap out prints from this elegant aluminum shadow box frame that perfectly matches photo-eye Editions portfolio boxes. A series of magnets on each internal side of the frame allow one disassemble each frame with ease. 
<br /><br />
These magnetic frames consist of three main elements: base element, glass and profile. The base element is a combination of a dimensionally stable hard foam board and a sheet steel angular frame. Protruding edges facilitate the quick insertion and fixation of picture and glass pane.
<br /><br />
The pH-neutral hard foam board (PAT-tested, IPI Rochester) has a high planarity and is equipped on the front and rear side with an acid-free, white cover layer as well as a barrier coat made of aluminum for protection against humidity.
<br /><br />
The profile is  made of brushed aluminum. On the insides, special adhesive magnet strips ensure that the profile frame adheres to the base element coherently and perfectly during the insertion. Due to the permanent magnetic force, the secure function of the magnetic frame is maintained indefinitely.
