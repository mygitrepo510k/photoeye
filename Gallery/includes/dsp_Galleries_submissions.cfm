The best way to submit your work  to our Santa Fe gallery is to apply to the <A HREF="javascript:popUp('../../gallery/PhotoShowcase/NewDocumentation/Artists/SubmissionProcess2.cfm', 'window_Submit_Your_Work', 500, 260, 'no');">Photographer's Showcase</a>
 Many of the newest artists that we represent originally started as Photographer's Showcase artists. Also we occasionally invite Showcase artists to exhibit their work in group shows in our physical gallery.
<br /><br />
If you are in Santa Fe, you are welcome to drop your portfolio by the gallery for review.  Due to the high volume of submissions we do not offer critiques or feedback. The work must be dropped off and picked up 24 hours later. The gallery is not liable for work left in the gallery.    You are also welcome to send a CD with images. <br /><br /></div>
