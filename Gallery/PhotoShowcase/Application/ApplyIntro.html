                    This form is general information concerning yourself (i.e.. 
                    Name, address, etc.). All fields with a red asterix (<font color="red">*</font>) 
                    are required. There are also spaces available for you to fill 
                    out your photographic schooling, influential books, exhibitions, 
                    and your artist statement. All of this information will appear 
                    on your bio page <b><font color="red">exactly</font></b> as 
                    it is entered here, so please be wary of spelling, punctuation, 
                    and capitalization. Once it is submitted, any changes that 
                    you wish to make will have to be done here at <b>photo-eye</b> 
                    and could incur an additional expense.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 2 - Default Artwork Description: </b> To speed up 
                    data entry and reduce redundancy, this page will be used as 
                    the default information when no other information is included 
                    for each submitted piece of artwork. This information will 
                    be used as a template for all of your images unless you override 
                    it by filling out additional information unique to each piece 
                    of artwork submitted in Step 3. On this page include the basic 
                    information that will be used on most or all of your pictures. 
                    For example, if all of your images are gelatin-silver, include 
                    that information here under medium. There is no need to repeat 
                    this information on the pages describing each individual artwork 
                    if they are the same. There is a field in <b>Step 3 </b>to 
                    use the default page for all information which is a constant 
                    for your images.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 3 - Unique Artwork Description: </b>Fill out Information 
                    that is unique to each individual piece of artwork. If the 
                    information is the same as the information on the <b>Default 
                    Information Page</b> then leave the field blank and choose 
                    &quot;Use Default&quot;. Fill out a page for each piece of 
                    artwork that has been accepted. There are 2 &quot;Submit&quot; 
                    buttons on the bottom of this form, one to continue to the 
                    next step and the other to fill out another form for a unique 
                    piece of work. Please be sure to fill out as many forms as 
                    needed for <b>each individual piece that has anything different 
                    from the information filled out in Step 2. </b>By doing this, 
                    you will be able to control all of the information for each 
                    piece submitted to the Photographer's Showcase.<br>
