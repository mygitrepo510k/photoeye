<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The first and foremost reason to become a <b>Showcase</b> photographer is that your work will be part of a stunning, highly respected, fine-art photography site that has a tremendous world-wide audience. <br>
<br>
Over the past twenty-one years, <b>photo-eye</b> has grown to become the premier source for fine-art photographic books. Over the past ten years, <b>photo-eye Gallery</b> has shown exciting contemporary photography in our formal gallery in Santa Fe. Our mailorder catalogues are sent quarterly to a worldwide audience and include the largest selection of art photography books found anywhere. <b>photoeye.com</b> is the one of the web's foremost e-commerce sites devoted to fine-art photography. <!--- It includes our 10,000+ book title database - all keyword searchable, and our online Gallery of represented artists. ---></P>
<P><b>photo-eye Gallery</b>, Santa Fe, like most galleries, can represent relatively few artists. With the advent of the Internet, <b>photo-eye</b> is now able to show diverse work by serious, fine-art photographers from throughout the world. Our new online gallery,  the <b>Photographer’s Showcase</b>, lets photographers participate by uploading,   describing, and maintaining their own portfolios online, then showing that work to <b>photo-eye</b>'s international audience. Our demographics include curators, gallery directors, collectors, teachers, and other lovers of fine-art photography, over two thousand visitors a day, nearly a million visitors a year, the perfect audience to view portfolios of your work! </P>

<P><b>photo-eye</b> invites artists to submit work to be juried for this exciting new exhibition space. The <b>Showcase</b> is looking for quality artwork that utilizes photographic methods, either exclusively or in conjunction with other artistic processes. The successful portfolio is a cohesive body of work that demonstrates a freshness of vision. <b>photo-eye</b> is interested in showing personal artistic work, not commercial or stock photography. Acceptance is based on the quality of the work, not professional stature.</FONT>

<LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="black""><b>Work is Juried</b></font><br>
<b>photo-eye</b> juries the portfolios and chooses photographers to show online. There are two classifications for photographers accepted into the <b>Showcase</b>: <b>Represented</b> and <b>Independent</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>Represented</b><br>
The jury decides if a photographer is accepted into the Showcase Galleries as a Represented Artist. If so, they are included in either <b>Showcase Gallery One - Established Artists</b> or <b>Showcase Gallery Two - Emerging Artists</b>. Our experienced <b>photo-eye Gallery</b> staff in Santa Fe acts as the artist's agent, and is responsible for pre-sales customer service and post-sales follow-up. The Gallery commission is 30%. The work is offered for sale online through our secure server ordering system.<br>
<br>
<b>Independent</b><br>
The jury decides if a photographer is accepted into <b>Showcase Gallery Three - Independent Photographers</b>. If accepted, some or all of the portfolio images submitted to the jury may be shown. The photographer acts as an independent artist instead of being represented by <b>photo-eye</b>.  Independent artists have the freedom to develop their own customer relations and sell prints directly to clients. No commission is taken by <b>photo-eye</b>. Direct customer contact means that clients reach artists through email, rather than through photo-eye's online print purchasing system.  Independent artists are encouraged to link their portfolios to their own personal web sites. <br></LI><br>
<LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="black""><b>Juror's Criteria</b></font><br>
<b>Showcase Gallery One - Established Artists<br>Includes photo-eye Online Representation</b><br>
Artists are included whose work has an obvious long-term acceptance by the fine-art photographic community. This may include some or all of the following: major museum shows, significant monographs, and representation by at least two AIPAD (Association of International Photography Art Dealers) Galleries.<br>
<br>
<b>Showcase Gallery Two - Emerging Artists<br>Includes photo-eye Online Representation</b><br>
Artists included are those that the jury feels exhibit an exceptional freshness of vision, along with a seriousness of intent, which is consistent throughout their submitted portfolio. This includes documentary projects that may or may not be published elsewhere. These artists do not yet qualify as Established Artists.<br>
<br>
<b>Showcase Gallery Three - Independent Photographers</b><br>
Artists who show an obvious commitment to photography through the love of craft and  medium, with some strong individual images. There is no <b>photo-eye</b> Online representation. Instead the photographers may sell directly.
 <br></LI><br>
<LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="black""><b> Portfolios are Setup</b></font><br>
Once accepted by the jury, the photographer signs the artist agreement and pays the setup and exhibition fees. <b>photo-eye</b> then assigns the initial password so that the artist may access their portfolio setup pages. The artist fills out their r&eacute;sum&eacute;, chronology, and artist statements online, sequences their images, and includes descriptive information about each print, all online.<br></LI><br>
<LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="black""><b> Portfolios are Exhibited</b></font><br>
<b>photo-eye</b> reviews the online portfolios before giving final approval. The work is then made live and immediately integrates with the rest of the <b>photo-eye Galleries</b> at photoeye.com. The one year non-exclusive contract begins.<br></LI><br>

<LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="black""><b>When Sales are Made</b></font><br>
<b>Represented Artists</b><br>
<b>photo-eye Gallery</b> Santa Fe, acts as the artist's agent, taking a 30% commission on any sales. When a sale is made either online or by phone, <b>photo-eye</b> orders the print. The artist ships the matted artwork to <b>photo-eye</b> in Santa Fe, NM, USA. All matting, insurance, and shipping fees to Santa Fe are absorbed by the artist. <b>photo-eye</b> approves the print quality and presentation, then sends the artwork to the buyer. The buyer has a 14 day satisfaction guarantee return privilege. <br>
<br>
<b>Independent Artists</b><br>
The artist sells directly to the client. If a client is interested in purchasing a print, they click the <i>Contact Artist</i> link next to the print shown in the Independent Artist's portfolio. The artist is responsible for all pre-sales and post-sales customer service. A <b>photo-eye </b>disclaimer is shown when the <i>Contact Artist</i> link is clicked, releasing <b>photo-eye</b> from any involvement or liability in any sales that result.<br></LI><br>


<LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="black""><b>When Rights are Sold</b></font><br>
<b>Represented Artists</b><br>
<b>photo-eye</b> acts as the artist's agent negotiating any sales of rights on the artist's behalf with the artist's approval.<br>
<br>
<b>Independent Artists</b><br>
The artist negotiates any sales of rights to their own images.
