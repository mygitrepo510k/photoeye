        The <b>Showcase</b> is a database driven site that must meet our strict 
        requirements for size and resolution. The highest quality scans are made 
        from original prints. Second best are scans made from excellent slide 
        reproductions. Third choice for quality scans is from finely printed 
        reproductions. <b>photo-eye</b> reserves the right to refuse any scan 
        that does not meet the <b>Showcase</b><I> </I>standard. We will approve 
        all scans prior to showing the work online. <!--- If you are interested in having 
        <b>photo-eye</b> build your site, please review our Help Building Showcase 
        form for technical service fees. ---><br>

		      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC">Local sources such as Kinko's, AlphaGraphics, an image house, a typesetter, or a custom lab may be able to provide this service for you. Generally, today's flatbed scanners for quality web scans are so inexpensive that it is better to purchase one and learn the process. <br>
<br>
The artist is responsible for having scans made of their work to Showcase specifications. Save all images as jpegs using a .jpg extension. The compression ratio, should be around 75%, and with the width and/or height at least 1,000                 pixels (~ 14 inches) at 72 dpi (dots per inch). Each file size should be around 200k. Images should be named beginning with the word 'Image' followed by the number in the sequencing with a numbering system in the order you would like the juror's to view your work. Image1.jpg, Image2.jpg, Image3.jpg, etc.

        If you send 35mm slides to them, you should be able to have your scans saved on a Kodak Master Photo CD in 5 different resolutions for around $35 + shipping. However, you will need to tweak these images to our specifications since they’re not in the specified JPEG format and sizes.<br>
