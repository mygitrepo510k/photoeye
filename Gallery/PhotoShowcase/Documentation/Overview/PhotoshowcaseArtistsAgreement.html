		Occasionally discounts on prints are given to museums, other galleries, 
        interior designers, dealers, or authorized agents. Discounts range between 
        5 and 15%. Since  <b>photo-eye</b>  only takes a 30% commission on sales, any discount 10% or below will be deducted from the artist's percentage. Any discount above 10% will be split between the artist and <b>photo-eye</b>. 
        For example, if a 20% discount is given to a museum, then <b>photo-eye</b> 
        will absorb 10% and the artist 10%, resulting in a 20% commission paid to <b>photo-eye</b> instead 
        of the usual 30%. If a 10% discount is given to a collector, then the artist will absorb the entire discount and <b>photo-eye</b> will receive the normal 30% commission. No prior approval from the artist is needed in order 
        to discount prints.  <br>
