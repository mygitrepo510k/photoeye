      <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>What kind of work is the Showcase Jury looking for?</b></font><br>
        The <b>Showcase</b> is looking for quality artwork that utilizes photographic 
        methods, either exclusively or in conjunction with other artistic processes. 
        The successful portfolio is a cohesive body of personal, artistic work 
        that demonstrates a freshness of vision. Commercial or stock photography 
        should not be submitted. <br>
      </LI>
      <br>	  
      <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>What 
        if I’ve only recently begun photographing? Is there a required 
        amount of time that I need to have photographed before applying?</b></font><br>
        We are interested in photographers who are serious about their work and 
        who are creating fresh, original images. Whether you are new to the art 
        of photography or a veteran, we look forward to seeing your work, and 
        encourage you to apply.<br>

      <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>Do 
        I have to have gallery representation elsewhere before I may apply? </b></font><br>
        Gallery representation or prior experience with galleries is not required. 
        If you are new to exhibiting your work, we encourage you to apply.<br>
      </LI>

      <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>Does 
        my work have to be published in a book for me to apply? </b></font><br>
        Not at all. However if a book has been published, please submit that information with your online application. It will help us better understand the scope of 
        your work.<br>

      <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>I’m 
        going to be in Santa Fe soon. May I personally present work for review? 
        </b></font><br>
        Initially we will jury portfolios exclusivly online, beginning with photographers who requested information last year. At a future date, we may accept other kinds of applications.

        Through the <b>Showcase</b>, other galleries, museums, magazines and publishers 
        view your work. Our formal <b>photo-eye Gallery</b> in Santa Fe will exhibit 
        one Showcase artist each year. There is always the chance that other venues 
        will want to handle your work and/or <b>photo-eye Gallery</b> in Santa Fe may want to represent you. <br>

      <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>If 
        accepted, am I represented by photo-eye Gallery? </b></font><br>
        The <b>Photographer’s Showcase</b> at <b>photoeye.com</b> has a highly 
        visible presence as one of three distinct exhibition spaces. The other 
        spaces include <b>photo-eye Gallery</b> Represented Artists 
        and Magnum Photos <I>Collectors Prints</I>. If accepted, you will be an 
        exhibiting photographer online only, on the <b>Photographer’s Showcase</b> at 
        <b>photoeye.com</b>. <br>

      </LI>
      <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>Is 
        there a chance that I will become a represented artist at photo-eye Gallery?</b></font><br>
        Currently, <b>photo-eye Gallery</b> Santa Fe, is not reviewing portfolios and is 
        not taking on new artists. However, there will be at least one Showcase photographer invited to exhibit at photo-eye Gallery in Santa Fe. <br>

      <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>What 
        is a Photographer’s Resum&eacute;? </b></font><br>
        A Photographer’s Resum&eacute; is much like a work experience resume but 
        is focused on your experience as a photographer/artist. Examples of <b>Showcase</b> 
        Photographer's resum&eacute;s may be viewed under the Bios link by many of the Showcase photographers.<br>
        <br>
      </LI>
      <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>Is 
        the Showcase a non-exclusive agreement, meaning I can show work at other 
        galleries? </b></font><br>
        Yes, <b>photo-eye</b> wants you to be successful as an artist. Unlike many online 
        venues, we do not require that you sign an exclusive contract. Thus you 
        are free to choose other non-exclusive exhibition areas, giving your work 
        even more visibility. Our contract allows artists to show their work in 
        galleries around the country and on other Internet sites. <br>
