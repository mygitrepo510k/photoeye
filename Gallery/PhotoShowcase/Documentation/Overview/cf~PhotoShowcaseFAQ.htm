<hr noshade size="1">

<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><P><b>I. Overview</b></P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><P>What is the <I>Photographer’s Showcase</I>?</P>


<P>A juried online print exhibition and sales space at photoeye.com that showcases serious, fine-art photographers from throughout the world. </P>
<B><P>Who should apply?</P>
</B><P>Emerging and mid-career artists who want to exhibit and sell their work on a highly visible fine-art photography website. The <I>Showcase</I> is looking for personal, artistic work that demonstrates a freshness of vision. Acceptance is based on the quality of work, not professional stature.</P>
<B><P>Why should artists consider an online venue for exhibiting and selling their work?</P>
</B><P>The barriers for entry into a formal photography or art gallery are extremely high. Each time a gallery represents a new artist, a major commitment of time and money is made. The photo-eye Gallery in Santa Fe can only handle the work of twenty or so artists due to space limitations. Now with the advent of the Internet, we are able to show work by many talented photographers, allowing their portfolios to be viewed by thousands of visitors each day. The Gallery at photo-eye receives requests to look at new work each day, the <I>Photographer’s Showcase</I> now provides a place for high quality work to be shown.</P>
<B><P>How will the <I>Photographer’s Showcase</I> be advertised?</B> </P>
<P>The <I>Photographer’s Showcase</I> will be promoted in a variety of ways, including advertising in national and local media, and issuing press releases. Marketing will also be in the photo-eye booklist, a mailorder catalogue that is sent bi-monthly to a worldwide audience and includes the largest selection of fine-art photography books available anywhere. Whenever images from the <I>Showcase </I>are promoted in the booklist, credit is given to the artist.</P>

<P>II. Eligibility and Acceptance Criteria</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Who is eligible for the <I>Photographer’s Showcase</I>?</P>
</B><P>The <I>Showcase </I>is looking for quality artwork that utilizes photographic methods, either exclusively or in conjunction with other artistic processes. The successful portfolio is a cohesive body of personal, artistic work that demonstrates a freshness of vision. Commercial or stock photography should not be submitted. </P>
<B><P>What if I’ve only recently begun working with photography? Is there a required amount of time that I need to have worked with photography before applying?</P>
</B><P>We are interested in photographers who are serious about their work and who are creating fresh, original images. Whether you are new to the art of photography or a veteran, we look forward to seeing your work, and encourage you to apply.</P>
<B><P>Do I have to have gallery representation elsewhere before I may apply?</P>
</B><P>No gallery representation or prior experience with galleries is required. If you are new to exhibiting your work, we encourage you to apply.</P>
<B><P>Does my work have to be published in a book for me to apply?</P>
</B><P>Not at all. However if a book has been published, please submit it along with your application. It will help us better understand the scope of your work.</P>

<B><P>If accepted, am I represented by the photo-eye Gallery?</P>
</B><P>The Photographer’s Showcase at photo-eye.com has a highly visible presence as one of three distinct exhibition spaces. The other spaces include photo-eye Represented Artists from the Santa Fe Gallery and Magnum Photos <I>Collectors Prints</I>.

<B><P>Is there a chance that I will become a represented artist at photo-eye Gallery?</P>

<B><P>What is a ‘Photographer’s Resum&eacute;’?</P>

<B><P>Is the <I>Showcase</I> a non-exclusive agreement, meaning I can show work at other galleries?</P>
</B><P>Yes, photo-eye wants you to be successful as an artist. Unlike many online venues, we do not require that you sign an exclusive contract.

</B><P>photo-eye informs customers that, in general, they can expect to receive their print within 2-3 weeks of placing an order.

<B><P>What if I am out of town or on an extended trip when a print sells?</P>

<B><P>May I ever speak directly with a client?</P>
</B><P>No. photo-eye will act as your agent. If a customer has any questions, we will contact you. </P>

Discounts range between 5 and 20%, split evenly between the photographer and photo-eye. For example, if a 10% discount is given to a museum, then photo-eye will absorb 5% and the artist 5%, resulting in a 35% commission instead of the usual 40%. No prior approval from the artist is needed in order to discount prints. </P>
<B><P>Can I have a list of clients who have purchased my work? (Does this question need to be printed?)</P>
</B><P>No. explain why</P>
<B><P>Can I get credit in the photo-eye bookstore or the other galleries instead of a check for my sold prints?</P>
</B><P>For accounting purposes, the <I>Photographer’s Showcase</I>, other galleries, and the bookstore are all separate. You are welcome to place orders at anytime in either the bookstore or other galleries, but we cannot issue credit for prints sold of your own work.</P>
<B><P>What if I edition my prints – how will I advise you of price increases?</B> </P>
<P>You do not have to contact us, rather use your personal access password that allows you to make any changes to your prints by yourself. </P>
<B><P>Do I have to sell my work in numbered editions?</P>
</B><P>No. Editioning of work is a personal, artistic choice.</P>
<B><P>Why would a photographer edition work?</P>
</B><P>There are both advantages and disadvantages to editioning one’s work. Typically photographers will edition their work in numbers ranging from 10-50 prints. Collectors often feel reassured when an image is editioned because they know that only a set number of prints will ever be on the market. In reality though, it is unusual for prints to sell out in their edition. The disadvantage of editioning an image is that keeping track of numbers in the edition can be cumbersome.</P>
<B><P>How do I edition my work?</P>
</B><P>With a pencil, print the number of the print / edition ceiling (e.g. 1/5).</P>
<B><P>Does my work have to sell for the same amount in all galleries?</P>
</B><P>Yes. To be professional, you should sell your prints for the same price everywhere.</P>
<B><P>Does photo-eye have to approve my prices?</P>
</B><P>No. The artist determines the retail price for their artwork, however it should remain consistent in all venues.  When determining the price, you should keep in mind that all matting, insurance, and shipping feels to Santa Fe, NM, USA are absorbed by the artist.  Also, we take a 40% commission on sales. Your work should be priced according to what the market will bear, neither too low or too high. </P>
<B><P>Do I pay shipping costs to you and then again to the client?</P>
</B><P>No. You pay for the shipping and insurance costs only to photo-eye in Santa Fe, NM. </P>
<B><P>Can clients return prints? </P>
</B><P>Yes. photo-eye will accept all prints under our satisfaction guarantee policy. The client has 14 days from the date of shipping to return the artwork to photo-eye in the same condition. The artwork is then returned to the artist at photo-eye’s expense. </P>
<B><P>Can I show my work without making it available for sale? What if an image I want to show </P>
<P>is already sold out?</B> </P>
<P>Yes. You may show work that is not for sale. Indicate on the online form, NFS which means Not For Sale.<B> </P>
<P>If an art director wants to hire me to create new work based on seeing my page on the </P>
<P>Photographer’s Showcase, am I obligated to give photo-eye a percentage of creative</P>
<P>fees realized? </P>
</B><P>Yes. We act as your agent and will take an (X?) % commission.</P>
<B><P>If someone sees my work and contacts me directly am I obligated to give photo-eye a percentage of the sale?</B> </P>
<P>No. But you cannot advertise your address or your other gallery associations as part of your showcase.<B> </P>
<FONT size="3"><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Print and Mat Standards</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Do sold prints have to be matted?</P>
</B><P>Yes. As a protection for the print and the aesthetics of the work, we require that prints sold must be matted. The price of the print should include the cost of the mat. Please price your work accordingly.</P>
<B><P>What are your matting requirements?</P>
</B><P>We accept only 2 or 4 ply museum rag or conservation board for our mats. This board is readily available at many art supply stores as well as Light Impressions, a mail order supplier of archival materials. Windows should be cleanly cut with a 45 degree bevel. Windows must be hinged to a backing board using archival tape. Photographs can be either dry mounted or held in place with corners. </P>
<B><P>What if my work is framed?</P>
</B><P>We accept only matted prints. Frames are cumbersome and place the print in risk of damage during shipping.</P>
<B><P>What if I don’t know how to mat my own work? </P>
</B><P>Visit a frame shop in your hometown for advice or to employ them to cut mats for you. Insist on museum quality board.</P>
<B><P>Can you mat the work for me, before it’s shipped to the customer? (Check with Rick)<BR>
</B>Yes, we can provide this service. See Appendix B</P>
<B><FONT size="3"><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Shipping Standards</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>How do I best protect my work when I send it to you?</P>
</B><P>All prints must be packed to minimize the risk of damage while in transit. We highly recommend that you use a durable outside carton such as, Print Pad available from Air Float Systems, Inc. (800-445-2580 or www.airfloatsys.com). In addition to the outside carton, your artwork should be placed in a plastic archival print bag to help prevent abrasion of the print surface. One source for such bags is Light Impressions, Inc. (800-828-6216 or <A HREF="http://www.lightimpressionsdirect.com/">www.lightimpressionsdirect.com</A>).</P>
<B><FONT size="3"><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Technical Issues</P>
<FONT SIZE="2"><P>I am not very adept at the computer and am worried that my scans will not accurately translate the quality of my work? What should I do? </P>
</B><P>The <I>Showcase</I> is a database driven site that must meet our strict requirements for size and resolution. The highest quality scans are made from original prints, second best are scans made from excellent slide reproductions, and the third choice for quality scans is from printed reproductions. photo-eye reserves the right to refuse any scan that does not meet the <I>Showcase </I>standard. We will approve all scans prior to showing the work online. If you are interested in having photo-eye build your site, please review our Help Building Showcase form for technical service fees. </P>
<B><P>Where can I get scans made?</P>
</B><P>One of the least expensive service bureaus for scans we’ve found is:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><P>Advanced Digital Imaging Inc.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>135 W Oak St<BR>
Fort Collins, CO 80524<BR>
<A HREF="http://rd.yahoo.com/yp/phonebooth/?http://phonebooth.yahoo.com/?dto=9704843351">(970) 484-3351</A></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>http://www.adiweb.com/services.htm</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<B><P>How much will it cost me?</P>
</B><P>If you send 35mm slides to them, you should be able to have your scans saved on a Kodak Master Photo CD in 5 different resolutions for around $35 + shipping. However, you will need to tweak these images to our specifications since they’re not in the specified JPEG format and sizes.</P></FONT>
