	    <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>How will I know when a print has sold?</b></font><br>
        <br>
		<b>Represented Artists</b><br>
		When a 
        sale is made either online or by phone, <b>photo-eye</b> sends the artist 
        a purchase order by e-mail, fax or phone. The artist ships the matted 
        artwork to <b>photo-eye</b> in Santa Fe, NM. <b>photo-eye</b> approves the print 
        quality and presentation, then sends the artwork to the buyer. As part of the online ordering process, customers should expect to receive 
        their print(s) within 2-4 weeks of placing an order. However, if a photographer 
        is unable to deliver a print to <b>photo-eye</b> within a reasonable 
        period, then <b>photo-eye</b> will inform the customer of such delays. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Independent Photographers</b><br>
		Sales are made directly. You will receive an email from the client who is interested in your work.<br>

	  <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>What if I am out of town or on an extended trip when a print sells?</b></font><br>
      If you are going to be out of town for an extended period, we encourage you to communicate your leave of absence with someone at the telephone and/or email that you have provided. There is no need to e-mail or contact us before you leave or when you return unless you need to change your contact email, address, or phone.<br>

	    <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>May I ever speak directly with a client?</b></font><br>
        <br>
		<b>Represented Artists</b><br>
		No. <b>photo-eye</b> will act as your agent. If a customer has any questions, 
        we will contact you. <br>
		        <br>
		<b>Independent Photographers</b><br>

      <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>What 
        if a client wishes to see work that is not included in the Showcase?</b></font><br>
        <br>
		<b>Represented Artists</b><br>
        <b>photo-eye</b> acts as your agent. If a customer requests to see other 
        work, we will contact you to send images. <br>
				<b>Independent Photographers</b><br>

	  <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>Do you ever offer discounts to clients, and if so, how do you handle discounts?</b></font><br>
        		<b>Represented Artists</b><br>

		Occasionally discounts on prints are given to museums, other galleries, 
        interior designers, dealers, or authorized agents. Discounts range between 
        5 and 15%. Since  <b>photo-eye</b>  only takes a 30% commission on sales, any discount 10% or below will be deducted from the artist's percentage. Any discount above 10% will be split between the artist and <b>photo-eye</b>. 
        For example, if a 20% discount is given to a museum, then <b>photo-eye</b> 
        will absorb 10% and the artist 10%, resulting in a 20% commission paid to <b>photo-eye</b> instead 
        of the usual 30%. If a 10% discount is given to a collector, then the artist will absorb the entire discount and <b>photo-eye</b> will receive the normal 30% commission. No prior approval from the artist is needed in order 
        to discount prints. <br>

	  <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>Can I get credit in the photo-eye bookstore or the other galleries instead of a check for my sold prints?</b></font><br>
        For accounting purposes, the <b>Photographer’s Showcase</b> and our other online galleries at <b>photoeye.com</b>, 
        and the bookstore are separate divisions of photo-eye Books &amp; Prints. You are welcome to place orders at 
        anytime in either the bookstore or other galleries, but we cannot issue 
        book or print credit for prints sold.<br>

<LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>What if I edition my prints – how will I advise you of price increases?</b></font><br>
     You do not have to contact us, rather use your personal access password that allows you to make any changes to your prints by yourself.<br>
      </LI>
      <br>
	  
	  <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>Do I have to sell my work in numbered editions?</b></font><br>
     No. Editioning of work is a personal, artistic choice.<br>
      </LI>
      <br>


	  
	   <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>Why would a photographer edition work?</b></font><br>
   There are both advantages and disadvantages to editioning one’s work. Typically photographers will edition their work in numbers ranging from 1-50 prints. Collectors often feel reassured when an image is editioned since they know that only a set number of prints will ever be on the market. In reality though, only the most popular prints ever sell out of their edition. Editions with a prices that change based on the number of prints sold encourages collectors to buy new work instead of their more expensive, popular imagery.<br>
<br>
The disadvantage of editioning an image is that keeping track of numbers in the edition can be cumbersome and some perceive that it artificially inflates the market.<br>
      </LI>
      <br>





<LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>How do I edition my work?</b></font><br>
   With a pencil, print the number of the print / edition ceiling (e.g. 1/5) on the front or back of the actual photograph. Do not put edition numbers on the mat.<br>
      </LI>
      <br>
	  
	  
	  <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>Does my work have to sell for the same amount in all galleries?</b></font><br>
   Yes. To be professional, you should sell your prints for the same price everywhere.<br>
      </LI>
      <br>
	  
	    <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>Does photo-eye have to approve my prices?</b></font><br>
   No, unless the staff feels it is unreasonable. The artist determines the retail price for their artwork, however it should remain consistent in all venues.  When determining the price, you should keep in mind that all matting, insurance, and shipping feels to Santa Fe, NM, USA are absorbed by the artist.  For Represented Artists, remember that <b>photo-eye</b> takes a 30% commission on sales. Your work should be priced according to what the market will bear, neither too low or too high. However the minimum price allowed on the site is $200.<br>

 <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>Do I pay shipping costs to you and then again to the client?</b></font><br>

      <br>
	  
	  <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>Can clients return Represented Artists prints?</b></font><br>

        policy. The client has 14 days from the date of shipping to return the 
        artwork to <b>photo-eye</b> in the same condition. The artwork is then 
        returned to the artist at <b>photo-eye’s</b> expense.<br>

	   <LI><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" Color="#FFFFCC"><b>Can I show my work without making it available for sale? What if an image I want to show is already sold out?</b></font><br>
