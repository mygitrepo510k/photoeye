It is essential that the digital images of your photography be of the highest professional quality.  The following size and resolution requirements ensure maximum clarity and resolution for your images when viewed on the plethora of monitors and platforms available.  These guidelines will assist you in producing the highest-quality files for your images.<br /><br />

<li><b>If Scanning Your Images</b><br />
The highest quality scans are made from prints, negatives or transparencies; only scan small prints or book reproductions if necessary.  If you are scanning from an image 4î or smaller, consult your scanner's user manual for the highest possible optical (not interpolated) resolution use.<br /><br />

Once scans have been created, check for spots and blemishes.  Treat these digital files as you would a final print; they will represent the original prints on the Photographer's Showcase website.  photo-eye is not able to make changes to your images once they have been uploaded to our server.<br /><br />
</li>
<li><b>
Prepare Your Digital Files</b><br />
-If using Adobe Photoshop, set View &mdash; Proof Setup &mdash; Monitor RGB.  This should automatically turn Proof Colors on and the image name should now read [yourimage.xxx@xxx%(RGB/Monitor].  When you turn this setting on, the tones/color of your image may change dramatically &mdash; the image now appears as it will on a website when saved as a JPG.<br /><br />

-Make your color/tonal corrections.  Your digital file should match your prints as closely as possible.
<br /><br />
-Crop your images completely so that no white border outside the images is visible unless it is intentional.
<br /><br />
-Resolution should be set at 72 dpi (dots per inch).
<br /><br />
-Width and/or height of the image should be at least 1,000 pixels (approx. 14 inches).
<br /><br />
- If using Adobe Photoshop, make sure that 'Constrain Proportions' and 'Resample Image: Bicubic' are both checked.
</li><br /><br />
<li><b>
Save Your Images</b><br/>
-If using Adobe Photoshop, be sure to 'Save for Web,' as this removes color profiles and other information from the image, ensuring that it will appear the same on different browsers.  Save the image as a JPG using the setting outlined below.  Once you click 'Save,' you will be prompted to select a location and name for your image.  Make sure the 'Save as Type' option below the name field is set to 'Images Only.'
<br /><br />
-The compressed file size for each image should be between 100-300k.  When saving your file as a JPG, set the 'Quality Level' setting to 7 (or 75% -- the 'Medium' setting in some versions of PhotoShop) and your file size should automatically fall into this range.  To check the file size of your images after saving, do so without opening the images. Open images are decompressed and the file size will appear larger.
</li><br /><br />
<li><b>
Name Your Images</b><br/>
-Very important!  Name your image files in the order in which you would like your work to be viewed.  This is extremely important if your work is a visual narrative.  The file names must be exactly as follows: <span style="color:red;">Image1.jpg, Image2.jpg, etc. (not Image_1.jpg or any other variation)</span>.  Do not include any other information as part of the filename.  Make sure to name the files .jpg and not .jpeg.  These filenames are for the jurying process only.  If your work is accepted, you will be able to title your images within your Showcase administration page online.  
</li><br /><br />
<li><b>
Upload Your Images to Our Server</b><br/>
-Once your application fee is paid, you will receive an email with a link to your personal upload page where you will continue the application process.  The simple form-based system will allow you to include your CV and statements as well as transfer your images.
<br /><br />
-A typical high-speed connection should take 3-5 minutes to upload a portfolio of 20 images to our server.  Lower connection speeds may result in a wait of 1-5 minutes per image.  Please be patient!  A 'Finished Uploading' notification screen will appear when the file transfers are complete.
</li><br /><br />
photo-eye reserves the right to refuse any image that does not meet the Photographer's Showcase specifications.  We will approve all images prior to showing the work online.  If you have any questions regarding your images or this procedure, please call 1800.227.6941 and ask for Photographer's Showcase help.  We will be happy to assist you.

<font face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Photographer's Showcase</b> 
      is a powerful, database driven website. In order to ensure maximum clarity 
      and resolution for your images when viewed on the plethora of monitors and 
      platforms available, we have instituted strict requirements for size and 
      resolution. These guidelines will assist you in producing the highest-quality 
      scans of your images.<br>
      <br>
      If you do not have a scanner and/or will hire a service bureau to produce 
      scans for you, please take this sheet with you to ensure your work will 
      meet these specifications.<br>
      <br>
      <li><b>Scan your Images</b><br>
        Each image is seen in various sizes in the many sections of the <b>Photographer's 
        Showcase</b> online gallery. The quality of the scans submitted to the 
        <b>Photographer's Showcase</b> should be extremely high as this will be 
        what the jury will view. If your scans are accepted, they will be distilled 
        by <b>photo-eye</b> into the various sizes needed to showcase your work. 
        The highest quality scans are made from original prints or large transparencies; 
        only scan from 35mm slides, small prints, or book reproductions if necessary. 
        If you are scanning from an image 4" or smaller, consult your scanner's 
        users manual for the highest possible optical (not interpolated) resolution 
        to use.<br>
		<br>
      - Once your scans have been produced, 
      they should be checked for spots and blemishes.  Treat these scans as you would a final print; 
      they will represent the original prints on the <b>Photographer's Showcase</b> 
      website. <b>photo-eye</b> is not able to make changes to your scans once 
      they have been uploaded to our server. <br><br>
	  - If you are using Adobe Photoshop, set <b>View - Proof Setup - Monitor RGB</b>. This should automatically turn <b>Proof Colors</b> on and the image name at the top of the program should now read <b>[yourimage.xxx @ xxx% (RGB/Monitor)]</b>. When you turn this setting on, the tones / colors of your image may change radically -- it now appears the same as it will on a website when it's saved as a JPEG.<br><br>
      - Make your color / tonal corrections.<br>
	  </li>
      <br>
      <li><font color="black" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Adjust 
        Scans Using These Specifications</b></font><br>
		
		-Please be sure to crop your images completely so that no white border outside the images is visible unless it is intentional.<br>
        - Resolution: 72 dpi (dots per inch)<br>
        - Width and/or Height to be at least 1,000 pixels (~ 14 inches)<br>
        - If you are using Adobe Photoshop, make sure both <i>Constrain Proportions</i> 
        and <i>Resample Image: Bicubic </i>are BOTH CHECKED.<br>
		
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Save Images as JPEGs</b><br>  
	  - If you are using Adobe Photoshop, be sure to <b>Save for Web</b>, this removes color profiles and other information from the image, ensuring that it will appear the same on different browsers. When you select <b>Save for Web</b> a new window will open with your image on the left and a panel of options on the right. Save the image as a JPEG using the settings outlined below. Once you click SAVE it will prompt you to select a location and name, make sure the <b>Save as Type</b> option below the name field is set to <b>Images Only.</b><br><br>
- The goal is to achieve a compressed file size between 100-300k. When
saving the file as a JPEG, a Quality Level setting of 7, 75%, (the
Medium JPEG setting in some versions of Photoshop) will achieve this.
DO NOT USE THE PROGRESSIVE OPTION. When viewing an image in Adobe
Photoshop or another image processing program, you are viewing the <b>decompressed</b> 
        file and it will appear larger than 100-300k. After saving the image, 
        view the file size without opening the image. <br>
		<br>
		- <strong>Very Important!</strong>
Name the image files in the order in which you would like the jurors to
view your work. This is extremely important if your work is a visual
narrative. The filenames of the images must be EXACTLY as follows: <font color="red" face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif">Image1.jpg, Image2.jpg, etc. (NOT Image_1.jpg).</font> There can be <strong>NO OTHER INFORMATION</strong> as part of the filename. In other words, <strong>DO NOT</strong> add to the filename, <font color="red" face="Verdana, Arial, sans-serif">Image1.jpg</font>
and make it Image1_thetitle.jpg. Make sure you use .jpg and NOT .jpeg
when naming files. These filenames are for the jurying process only. If
the work is accepted, you will be able to title your work within your
Showcase account online. Call 1-800-227-6941 if you are still not clear.<br><br><!--- All of your scans must be named Image1.jpg, Image2.jpg, Image3.jpg, etc. as this is the requirement for showing the work at <b>Photographer's Showcase</b>. Name them in the order you would like the jurors to view your work. Do not use the title of the image as the name of the file. Use your title list as a way to cross reference your scans.     --->
