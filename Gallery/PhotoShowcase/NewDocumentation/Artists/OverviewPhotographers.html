Multiple portfolios can be created for other projects, keeping your work well organized and viewed in the appropriate context.<br /><br />

Portfolios on the <b>Photographer's Showcase</b> are self-administered, allowing artists to input and maintain their own biographical information and update their image data. The opening of new Showcase portfolios are accompanied by an announcement in our weekly email newsletter that is received by over twenty thousand photography enthusiasts worldwide.

For almost 10 years, the <b>Photographer's Showcase</b> has been an impeccable marketing tool for the serious photographer.<br /><br />

Unlike many similarly aimed websites, <b>Photographer's Showcase</b> artists benefit from association with the world-renown photo-eye name and are linked to our high-traffic website, which receives over seven thousand unique visitors everyday. photo-eye is an institution in the photo world, with an expansive catalogue, including out-of-print book auctions, photo-eye Magazine and vibrant galleries and has become a resource for curators, galleries, collectors, critics and photography enthusiasts from around the world.<br /><br />

Beyond partnership with photo-eye.com, <b>Photographer's Showcase</b> artists also benefit from the strength in association with other talented photographers.

The <b>Photographer's Showcase</b> seeks to represent promising immerging or established photographers to help provide the exposure need to bring them to the next step in their careers.<br /><br />

Through exhibiting on the Photographer's Showcase, a number of photographers have been presented with fantastic opportunities for career advancement and the exposure of their work to a wider audience.  These opportunities have included exhibitions, image licensing, magazine features, gallery representation, and of course, print sales.  Some of these opportunities may come from photo-eye itself, including possible exhibitions in our physical gallery space in Santa Fe, NM, as well as inclusion in photo-eye Gallery's booth at art fairs.  These opportunities do not arise for every photographer, but photo-eye Gallery, as well as others who frequently visit the Photographer's Showcase, are always scouting for photographers who show special potential.  The <b>Photographer's Showcase</b> has proven to be a fantastic way to position yourself for these opportunities as part of a website that has become a resource for curators, galleries, collectors, critics and photography enthusiasts from around the world.<br /><br />
