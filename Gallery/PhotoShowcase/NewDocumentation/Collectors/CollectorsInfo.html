			<font color="Black" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif" size="2"><br><b>Order Fulfillment</b><br><br>
Print orders are usually fulfilled within a 2-4 week period. Print inventory is not kept on hand at <b>photo-eye</b> but is ordered on demand directly from the individual artist. As soon as an order is received and processed, the <b>Photographer's Showcase</b> artist is contacted and the artwork is sent to <b>photo-eye</b> where it  is inspected by our Gallery staff before being sent to the purchaser. The buyer is informed of any delays in processing or shipping.<br><br>

			<font color="Black" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif" size="2"><b><br>Print Quality and Authenticity</b><br><br>
All print sales are directed through <b>photo-eye Gallery</b> located in Santa Fe. Our gallery personnel inspect each print before shipping the order to the buyer. <b>photo-eye</b> requires all photograpers to process their work to professional archival standards. Prints must have an unblemished surface with careful spotting of all imperfections. <br><br>
There are several ways in which original artwork is authenticated. Most artists sign and number their work on either the front or back of the artwork. If this is not the case, <b>photo-eye</b> and the <b>Photographer's Showcase</b> will provide a letter of authenticity.<br><br>

			<font color="Black" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif" size="2"><br><b>Matting and Framing</b><br><br>
All prints are professionally matted using museum or 100% rag board, unless the artwork is sold ready to frame, hang, or display and it is the intention of the artist that it not be overmatted. Framing is not included in the price of the artwork, nor is it a service that is provided through the <b>Photographer's Showcase</b>. <br><br>
