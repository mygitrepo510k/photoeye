</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>What is the Photographer’s Showcase?</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>An online gallery at photoeye.com that showcases the work of fine-art photographers</P>

<B><P>Who this is for?</P>
</B><P>The emerging and mid-career artist who wants to promote their work in a mainstream online gallery to a focused market</P>

<B><P>Why does this exists?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</B><P>The barrier to entry into formal photography or art galleries is extremely high. Naturally, commercial galleries have to make money. Each time a gallery takes on an artist, it is a major commitment of time and money. Photo-eye Gallery spends thousands of dollars for matting, framing, hanging a show with announcements printed and mailed, and an opening reception held, each time we mount an exhibit. It is impossible to do this on a yearly basis for more than a dozen artists. Yet, there is terrific work out in the world that deserves to be seen. Each day we receive requests to look at new work. Photographer’s Showcase now provides a place for this work to be shown.</P>

<B><P>Who visits our gallery online?</P>
</B><P>We have a high profile market including collectors, curators, gallery directors, historians, photographers, critics, and lovers of art photography. It is the heart of the fine-art photographic community, worldwide.</P>

<B><P>Why should I apply?</P>
</B><P>Exposure of your work to the above community is the key advantage. From here you could be signed up by a gallery (perhaps even our formal photo-eye Gallery), your work could be sold to a collector, contacts could be made for commercial assignments, or rights to your work could be sold for use in publications.</P>

<B><P>Will work be sold?</P>
</B><P>We will forward any interest in sales directly to you. If a work or rights are sold as a result of this interest, we would receive a 15% commission on the sale. However, it is between you and the buyer to negotiate your terms.</P>

<B><P>Wendy! How is quality maintained? </P>
</B><P>Not only do we review scans, but we look at matted photographs, your shipping techniques, and the quality of the work, before going live with your images online. </P>

<B><P>How do I guarantee satisfaction for the purchaser of my work?</P>
</B><P>You will agree to give the customer a 10 day satisfaction guarantee. If for any reason they do not like the work, they may return it to you for a full refund (less their shipping charges for sending the print back).</P>

<B><P>What if they want to pay with a credit card? </P>
</B><P>Accept only check or money orders.</P>

<B><P>Who else will be in the gallery?</P>
</B><P>Serious quality photographers who are serious about promoting their work</P></DIR>
